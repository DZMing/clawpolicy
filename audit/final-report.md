# Full Audit Final Report (2026-03-01)

## Summary

- Scope: full repository (`lib/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, docs).
- Priority: stability first.
- Delivery model: P0/P1/P2 batches.
- Result: critical and high-risk issues fixed with TDD; release-gate blockers closed.

## Verification

- Docs consistency:
  - Command: `python3 scripts/check_docs_consistency.py`
  - Result: `OK (tests=80, action_dim=11)`
- Full tests:
  - Command: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -q`
  - Result: `80 passed`
- Package:
  - Command: `python3 -m build && python3 -m twine check dist/*`
  - Result: `sdist/wheel build + metadata check pass`
- Governance docs in sdist:
  - Command: `tar -tzf dist/clawpolicyment-1.0.0.tar.gz | rg \"CONTRIBUTING|SECURITY|SUPPORT|CODE_OF_CONDUCT|RELEASING|CHANGELOG\"`
  - Result: all required files present
- Phase3 full deps path:
  - Command: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements-full.txt && python3 -m pytest tests/test_phase3.py -q`
  - Result: pass (`21 passed`)

## Performance Snapshot

- `reward.calculate_reward`: ~253k ops/s
- `agent.select_action(explore=False)`: ~55k ops/s
- `agent.update_policy(single-step)`: ~32k ops/s

## Key Changes Landed

- Environment normalization and input hardening:
  - task type fallback and context normalization
  - robust `time_of_day` parsing and clamping
- Integration config persistence hardening:
  - preserve wrapper schema
  - create parent dir automatically
- Agent inference and decoding stability:
  - deterministic no-explore action
  - explicit index shape/range validation
- CLI reliability fix:
  - `--help` path now valid
- Release governance:
  - MANIFEST now includes release/community/security documents
  - SECURITY docs include explicit private advisory URL and security email placeholder
- Distributed runtime safety:
  - auto-fallback to sequential mode when Redis/Celery runtime is unavailable
  - full-dependency CI verification added
- Minor maintainability cleanup:
  - removed unused computation in policy update path

## Residual Risk / Follow-ups

1. RuntimeWarning when running `python -m lib.integration --help` remains (from package import timing).
   - Recommendation: switch to lazy exports in `lib/__init__.py` in next patch.
2. `requirements-full.txt` installs heavy optional stack; CI cost may increase.
   - Recommendation: keep one full-deps lane and one graceful-fallback lane, monitor duration.
